Another main reason you share this knowledge with my kids as ddd states: 

Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.
